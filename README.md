# Libre Mesh Community Portal

Based on [pitbull](https://github.com/libremesh/pitbull) but meant to run the Captive Portal on a [Single-board computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) instead of a Libre Mesh router.

## Beta

`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luandro/libre-portal/master/beta/cook.sh | bash`

## Usage

- Build the router
- Build the captive portal into the single-board computer
